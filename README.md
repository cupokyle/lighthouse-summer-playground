# Lighthouse Summer Playground

#### This project is a judgement-free collaborative website intended to help those of us in the Lighthouse Labs July 2021 cohort to get a little bit of practice working with Git, GitHub, open-source projects, collaborative working environments, and all the things that come with them.

## How to get started:

**Perform these commands on your local computer in the Terminal**

## 1. Clone this repository to your local computer

`git clone https://github.com/cupokyle/lighthouse-summer-playground.git`

## 2. Create your own branch, and name it your own name please! (or your github username)

`git branch <your-github-username-here>`

### And please checkout to your personal branch before making changes

`git checkout <your-branch-here>`

## 3. Add any files, make any changes, and do any edits you like to this website, in order to sharpen whatever skills you feel need sharpening.

## 4. Commit your changes and then push your commits up to the remote repository

##### (I'm still not 100% sure on these instructions. I am new to GitHub which is part of why I'm running this drill for myself.)

`git push`

## 5. The website is meant to be a mushy, messy, pile of whatever... so don't worry if you accidentally break things, make it weird, completely destroy the website.

##### (It's GitHub.. we can always rebuild it, or go back to a previous commit if we want to)

## 6. And lastly, please keep it all appropriate. No foul language, no offensive materials etc...

`Be kind to others`
