# Lighthouse Summer Playground

### This project is a judgement-free collaborative website intended to help those of us in the Lighthouse Labs July 2021 cohort to get a little bit of practice working with Git, GitHub, open-source projects, collaborative working environments, and all the things that come with them.

## How to get started:

## 1. Clone this repository to your local computer

## 2. Create your own branch, and name it your own name please! (or your github username)

## 3. Add any files, make any changes, and do any edits you like to these websites, in order to sharpen whatever skills you feel need sharpening.

## 4. Commit your changes and make a pull request.

## 5. The website is meant to be a mushy, messy, pile of whatever... so don't worry if you accidentally break things, make it weird, completely destroy the website.

##### (It's GitHub.. we can always rebuild it, or go back to a previous commit if we want to)

## 6. And lastly, please keep it all appropriate. No foul language, no offensive materials etc...
