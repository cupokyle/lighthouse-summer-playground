# Lighthouse Summer Playground

#### This project is a judgement-free collaborative website intended to help those of us in the Lighthouse Labs July 2021 cohort to get a little bit of practice working with Git, GitHub, open-source projects, collaborative working environments, and all the things that come with them.

## How to get started:

**Perform these commands on your local computer in the Terminal to get started**

_I, myself am not using the vagrant vm for this project_

## 1. Clone this repository to your local computer

`git clone https://github.com/cupokyle/lighthouse-summer-playground.git`

## 2. Create your own branch, and name it your own name please! (or your github username)

`git branch <your-github-username-here>`

eg: $ _git branch your-github-username-here_

### 3. Checkout to your personal branch before making changes

`git checkout <your-branch-here>`

eg: $ _git checkout your-branch-here_

###### you can always check which branch you're currently on by using this command:

`git branch`

## 4. Add any files, make any changes, and do any edits you like to this website, in order to sharpen whatever skills you feel need sharpening.

_have some fun in your code editor!_

## 5. Stage your changes using git

`git add <your-file-name-here>` or `git add .` to add all your file changes

_eg $ git add index.html_ this stages the changes you've made in the index.html file to the **"git staging area"**

## 6. Commit your changes

`git commit -m "insert a message"`

_this commits your staged changes to your current branch_

## 7. Push your changes up to the remote repository

`git push -u origin <your-branch-name>`

eg: $ _git push -u origin your-branch-name_

##### (I'm still not 100% sure on these instructions. I am new to GitHub which is part of why I'm running this drill for myself.)

## 8. Now your branch should be updated on GitHub! You can check out this original repository in the browser and make a Pull Request, at which point I will be able to accept the request and implement the changes to the master branch.

### The website is meant to be a mushy, messy, pile of whatever... so don't worry if you accidentally break things, make it weird, completely destroy the website.

## And lastly, please keep it all appropriate. No foul language, no offensive materials etc...

`Be kind to others`
